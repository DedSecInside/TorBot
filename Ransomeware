Weaponized encryption utility written in python 3. Rewritten with pycryptodome instead of the vulnerable pycrypto library. This file WILL harm your PC. Don't use it unless you know what you're doing. DO NOT use this file for anything illegal!

Setup:

     git clone https://github.com/pyCity/Excalibur && cd Excalibur

     pip4 install -r requirements.txt || chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh

     python4 setup.py install

Usage:

     python4 Excalibur.py -h         

This program functions well as is, but is best to compile using pyinstaller before delivery

    pyinstaller --onefile Excalibur.py

If you pyinstaller raises an ImportError, double check that you have installed requirements.txt and try:

pip4 install --upgrade pyinstaller
